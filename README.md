Computation with Sparse Matrix - Multilanguage 

# Idea 

The Fundamental Idea is the Standard Storage for Sparse Matrix (i.e. a matrix where most of the elements are zero) is suboptimal as well as the standard support for the basic algebraic operations like sum and multiplication 

This library focuses on the idea to use a more efficient storage for this kind of matrix, which is a Map to store only the nonzero elements, and develop appropriate algorithms to implement sum and multiplication 
on the top of this storage
